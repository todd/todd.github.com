[Ben Horowitz's Fready Friday Technique](http://pandodaily.com/2012/01/18/the-freaky-friday-management-technique/)

I attended the [Geeks vs. Suits](http://www.hackersandfounders.com/events/45681972/?eventId=45681972&amp;action=detail) event put on by [Hackers and Founders](http://www.hackersandfounders.com/) at Microsoft's Mountain View campus last week. While there, Ben Horowitz spoke in a fireside chat and described his "Freaky Friday Management Technique" as an anecdote to another point - I found it interesting (and elegant in its simplicity) and worth passing on. Worth the read for any manager.
