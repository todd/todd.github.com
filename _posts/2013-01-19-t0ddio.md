I recently set up this domain that I've had for several months to point to my blog. At the same time, I also decided to redesign the layout from scratch.

Being a developer and, therefor, being an awful designer by default, I turned to a toolkit I read about on Hacker News several months back called [Roots](http://roots.cx). Roots is the business because it combines the awesome power of [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) and [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) into a single toolkit that includes a Rails-like development server/watcher that will automatically render and reload your changes as you save files. It makes prototyping and developing quick and easy.

I've open-sourced the Roots project behind this blog. You can check out the source and how easy Roots makes design development [on my GitHub](https://github.com/todd/blog).
