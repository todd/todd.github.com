I'm frustrated this morning.

Over at TechCrunch, Peter Ha has penned a post [nitpicking Google's Project Glass](http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/26/googles-project-glass-an-exercise-in-mediocrity/) - a product best described as a prototype. For anyone who hasn't read the post, let me get you up to speed.

Sebastian Thrun, the founder of Google's skunkworks X laboratory was on [Charlie Rose](http://www.charlierose.com/guest/view/7439) last night to discuss, among other things, Project Glass. It's actually a pretty great interview in and of itself - Thrun and Rose discuss Glass and Google's autonomous cars (also a Google X project), Thrun ducks some broader questions about Google X, and they talk about Udacity (Thrun's online univeristy experiment). 

But, I suspect for most geeks like me, the most exciting part of the interview is when Thrun actually demos the Project Glass glasses he's wearing and [takes a picture of Rose](https://plus.google.com/101416274833608453021/posts/TG7rQ2Y9dqW) with them. They actually work! This isn't just a public display of a funky-looking headpiece or a dead-end, Microsoft-esque [vision of the future video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=9c6W4CCU9M4). Thrun proved last night that these things are the real deal - and that excites me a lot.

Ha, meanwhile, seems only to want to poke holes in this very public, very brief demo. He compares the quality of (remember, still a prototype) Glass's camera to that of the iPhone 4S (a well-polished Apple device with a best-in-class camera system). He bemoans the fact that the debut video showed the user controlling Project Glass with their voice and that, in his demo, Thrun had to press a button and use gestures to take the photo and upload it to Google+.

Is he for real? **No one** is doing anything like this. I find his entire piece to be an exercise in absurdity. If the Glass unit Thrun was showing off had been a final version that was ready for review it would be one thing (and I'd even agree with Ha), but it's merely a prototype. There is clearly a lot of work left to do, but the progress shown so far is still extrememely exciting and promising.

Ha wraps up by saying:
> Be excellent again, Google. That's all we ask.

Likewise - let's give them a chance, shall we?
