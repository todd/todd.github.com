Last week, I was inspired by a [blog post](http://www.seomoz.org/blog/wanted-software-engineers-reward-12000) to roll my resume into its own API. The challenge, as described in one of SEOmoz's GitHub [repos](https://github.com/seomoz/ruby-job-application), was to build an API for your resume in Ruby. Having only very little experience with Ruby (and having meant to dive into it for a long time), I took the opportunity to teach myself something new.

Enter [RESTume](https://github.com/toddward/restume) (see what I did there?).

This was a project (the core of it, at least) that took me no time at all to throw together while I waited to hop on a plane last week. I fleshed out the rest of it (unit tests, Bundler support, [deployment on one of my VPSs](http://resume.dd0t.com)) over the course of this past weekend when I had downtime during the [Long Beach Grand Prix](http://gplb.com).

Needless to say, I'll be attaching a link to RESTume with any new job application I submit. If nothing else, it's an easy way to demonstrate ability and present yourself in a possibly unexpected way.
