*Disclosure: Every mobile device I currently own runs a variant of Android. My current phone is a Nexus S 4G, my backup phone is an EVO 4G, and the sole tablet I own is an original Xoom. I do not own any other type of device (iOS, WinPho, etc.). I wouldnâ€™t necessarily call myself an Android fanboy, but I am a fan of the platform and Google in general.*

Over the past couple of months, I've become increasingly frustrated by a number of friends and acquaintances that are completely enamored with Android tablets, despite having little to no experience with any such device. When I press them on why they want an Android tablet, they express their desire for a tablet, but don't want to own an Apple device. When further pressed to explain their dismissal of the iPad, all of them merely mumble something about not liking Apple devices. Which is fine until you realize that the devices they covet all offer significantly less value than the device they disdain.

Still, pointing this out doesn't seem to provoke any change in attitude towards Android tablets or the iPad. Which is understandable, I suppose - it's difficult to overcome preconceived notions without experiencing something yourself. But I say these things to them not because I'm pro-Apple or anti-Google, but because I'm pro-what-works. And, I'm sad to say, Android tablets do not work.

Not that I mean to say they aren't perfectly capable of doing the most basic things you'd expect them to do. Honeycomb (and now Ice Cream Sandwich, I'm sure) is a fine piece of software, but having a cutting-edge mobile operating system is only half of the battle. You need an app ecosystem to complement it and Honeycomb's has been and continues to be dismal. This is the primary reason I stopped using my Xoom seriously after only a month of ownership - the lack of apps to enhance the experience relegated it to a dusty corner of my nightstand, only to be used for casual browsing or email while I lie in bed. Sometimes I'll even pull up the Android Market to see if the app situation has gotten any better, but I always come away disappointed.

There are reasons for this, of course. One reason that has received significant attention in the press within the past year or so is the fragmentation of the Android platform and the strain that puts on developers and consumers. [Google even kinda-sorta addressed this at I/O](http://www.geek.com/articles/mobile/from-google-io-2011-android-fragmentation-questions-answered-20110510/)>. This is undoubtedly part of it, but I think there is a more fundamental cause that needs to be addressed: there is a negative feedback loop in play that has yet to be halted - developers don't want to take the time to develop for a platform without broad consumer adoption and consumers don't want to support a platform that lacks the means to enhance itself.

[Gartner projects](http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1800514) that, of the approximately 63.3 million tablets to be sold this year, merely 17% of them will run a derivative of Android. Compared to the commanding 73% share held by the iPad, it's no wonder that developers have been and are continuing to develop for iOS first while pushing Android to the backburner (if they put it on a burner at all). Marco Arment, founder of Instapaper, has [repeatedly](http://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-Instapaper-available-on-Android) [stated](http://www.marco.org/2011/12/07/standing-up-for-android) his belief that developing for Android is a waste of time - while I disagree when it comes to Android phones, I think his arguments would hold up well when examined under a Honeycomb-shaped microscope.

All of this culminates in a catalog of apps that, frankly, is stale and not particularly useful. This is the primary reason I hardly use my Xoom anymore - it's fine to consume the most basic of content on, but when I want or need something more engaging, it falls flat on its face. Which is really too bad considering the excellent selection of apps to be found on the Android Market for phones.

It has been said that there is no tablet market, there's only an [iPad Market](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/20/technology/as-pcs-wane-companies-look-to-tablets.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ref=technology). I would say this notion still holds true and is the prevailing thought behind this post - as long as developers won't develop quality apps for non-iPad tablets, users won't adopt them and the iPad market won't become the tablet market. Until the playing field is more level, I really cannot recommend an Android tablet to anyone.

I hope Ice Cream Sandwich changes all of that - I can't wait to see.
