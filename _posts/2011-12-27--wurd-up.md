["Wurd up."](http://penny-arcade.com/resources/just-wow1.html)

Oh, man - this is just unbelievable. I particularly enjoyed his petulant name-dropping only to be [called out](https://twitter.com/#!/ScottLowe/status/151594656700973056) by IGN's Scott Lowe. Paul Christoforo, the "marketing guru" behind this particular marketing SNAFU, reminds me a lot of [this guy](http://teamfortress.com/classes.php?class=scout#movie) - just far less awesome and way more unintentionally hilarious.
