[Content Owners Should Compete More Effectively](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/forget-sopa-copyright-owners-must-build-a-better-bittorrent.ars)

Jon Brodkin, writing for Ars Technica:

>Despite the content industry's success shutting some sites down, piracy still flourishes through BitTorrent, cyberlockers, peer-to-peer networks, and video streaming, Price argued. While piracy is unlikely to ever stop completely, many Internet users will turn to legitimate alternatives if the price and service are right.

This is why services like iTunes and Netflix have flourished - they made it easier to legitimately acquire content than to steal it. Consumers are less likely to pirate content if there's an attractive, easy method to get it legally. Piracy is ripe for disruption - the sooner content owners realize this, stop pushing bad legislation, and stop treating their customers like criminals, the better off we'll all be.
