Mike Ryan of Moviefone on first six minutes of <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>:

>So you've got Tom Hardy doing some sort of Hispanic accent (I think) that's filtered through a mask that makes his voice sound electronic. Going back to that scene on the plane, for all I know Bane was telling the authorities, "Hey, I would really like to be friends. Why are you attacking me? Be my friend!" I mean, look, there were a few sentences here and there that I could made out, but for the most part: no clue. What was weird -- for this short clip at least - it did make Bane a bit more terrifying. Though, over the course of a two hour movie, I would like to know what Bane is trying to say.

I had the opportunity to see a screening of the prologue last night and I have to echo these sentiments. Everything else about the sequence was excellent and it involves one of the craziest, ballsiest stunts I've seen committed to film. But it was maddening and a little distracting trying to figure out what Bane was saying. As my friend Josh and I walked out of the theater, we both said something along the lines of "That was awesome! But could you understand a word Bane was saying?" to each other.

But I'm sure they'll get it figured out before the film is released in the summer. These next seven months until its release are going to be excruciating.
