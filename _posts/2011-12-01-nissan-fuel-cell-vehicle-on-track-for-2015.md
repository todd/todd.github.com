[Nissan fuel cell vehicles on track for 2015](http://www.autoblog.com/2011/11/29/nissan-fuel-cell-vehicle-on-track-for-2015/)

Briefly, I want to mention how much it excites me that we're getting to the point where Fuel Cells will become pervasive. Hybrids and EVs are well and fine, but Fuel Cells have the potential to be cleaner and more efficient than both. I'm pleased by the progress Nissan has made in compacting their stack and making it more affordable - hopefully affordable enough for the masses within the next decade.
