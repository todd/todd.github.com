For some background, check out [these](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3397619) [items](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3397976) on Hacker News.

First, my apologies for not releasing this data at the beginning of the week like I said I would - I was in Tahoe for the New Year and got sick almost as soon as I got back.

Without further ado, I present the [aggregate demographics data](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B3VMx_O32Sl9ZDgzYmVkOGItZmUwYy00OTViLWFjZWEtZWRjNmExOWNmMjRl) I collected from HN users during the last week and a half. I'm putting this data into the public domain - do what you like with it, but play nice. I'll give you a high-level overview of the data in this post, but I encourage you to take a look at the source data if you're interested.

During the collection period, I logged 456 visits from 447 uniques. I'd like to think this is a meaningful sample size (for the most part, the results below jibe with my preconceived perception of HN user demographics), but I'd be lying if I said I didn't wish we had had more participation.

Anyway, let's jump in.

We'll start with the locale data. I logged 193 visits from users in the United States - this was far and away the majority of our visitors. India was next in a distant second with 22 visits, with the UK trailing not far behind at 20 visits. The chart below should give you a good feel for the distribution of visits by territory. Note that I've removed the US from the chart since the high figure heavily skewed it in an unhelpful way - just remember that the US is green on this chart.  ![map](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxe5frZbTX1qzl41y.png)  

Since the US had the most visits by far, I want to take a second to break down visitors by state. As you can see in the chart below, California had the greatest concentration with 54 visitors, followed by New York (20), Texas (13), New Jersey (12), and Massachusetts (11).

Moving on, we can look at the languages used on the machines of HN users. Unsurprisingly, English is most prevalent, followed by French, German, Japanese, and Korean.  ![a chart](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxe5gcHwfq1qzl41y.png)

Ok, now that we've got the locale data out of the way, we can get to the more technical stuff. Operating System concentration is about what I expected it to be - OS X is most prevalent, Windows isn't terribly far behind, and a smaller subset of HN users are using a derivative of Linux. Of OS X users, most have made the jump to Lion; some remain on Snow Leopard and a fraction of users are still using Leopard and Tiger. In the Windows world, Windows 7 is clearly the favorite among HN users; XP, despite being over a decade old, comes in second.

In terms of mobile, iOS has the greatest concentration. In fact, iOS devices used by HN users outnumber Android devices by more than 3 to 1. Unfortunately, Google Analytics isn't capable of tracking iOS version numbers, but iPhones and iPads have the same concentration (30 users a piece) with a sole iPod Touch to round things out. Android versions are all over the place, but there were no devices in the sample that used a version lower than 2.2. There were even a number of devices using versions of Ice Cream Sandwich.

Finally, we'll look at Browser stats. Chrome is the *clear* winner here with 55% of users using some version of the Google browser. Firefox is in a far second place, scoring 16.7%, followed by Safari (mobile and desktop) at 12.5%. Mozilla Compatible Agent, for those wondering, appears to belong to iOS devices with malformed User Agents - at least that's what a cursory search led me to believe (if someone has a better explanation, I'd be happy to post it here).  ![yet another chart](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxe5gwOuAo1qzl41y.png)

There is more information in the dataset that I didn't cover, but I feel like this is the data HN users are most curious about. If there is some dimension you'd like to see that isn't included in the dataset, sound off in the comments on HN and I'll do my best to accommodate you. I hope you guys find this information useful.
