[Google Begings Releasing SysAdmin Tools for OS X](https://plus.google.com/u/0/109088229817689076273/posts/M3zHnfEQMUw)

This is a really awesome move by Google - I hope building an open source community around SysAdmin tools for OS X will lead to a higher level of adoption of Macs in the enterprise.
