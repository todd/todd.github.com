[Reuters: Donors of bone marrow can be paid, court rules](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/02/us-donors-bone-marrow-idUSTRE7B11FR20111202)

While I hope this proves to be an effective measure for recruiting more marrow donors, I'm more concerned with donating because it's the right thing to do, not because I'll be compensated.
